## Profile

I am a machine learning researcher with a few different hats within the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a>:

* Professor of Machine Learning ([Machine Learning Research Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~parg) ⊂ [Information Engineering](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk) ⊂ [Department of Engineering Science](https://www.eng.ox.ac.uk));
* Director of the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems](http://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk);
* Official Fellow of <a href="http://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk">Exeter College</a> and 
* Faculty Member of the <a href="http://www.oxford-man.ox.ac.uk">Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance.</a>

I'm also a co-founder of [Mind Foundry](http://mindfoundry.ai).  If you want to get to know me in gruesome detail: 

* [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/bio) is a short biography;
* you can examine a [high-resolution photo]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/image/OsborneMike05.jpg) of me;
* my full academic CV is [available;]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/pdf/MAOsborne.pdf) 
* My news is available on [Twitter;](http://twitter.com/maosbot) 
* older news is available for <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/news">2013-2014. 
    
Within machine learning, I have particular expertise in Gaussian processes, active learning, Bayesian optimisation and Bayesian quadrature, and I am dead keen on the emerging field of [probabilistic numerics.](http://probabilistic-numerics.org) I have applied machine learning to scientific and engineering problems in fields as diverse as exoplanet search, finance, crystallography, autonomous robotics, and the study of pigeon navigation. I'm also interested in how new technologies, particularly machine learning, are changing the nature of work.
