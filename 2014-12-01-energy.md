Machine learning will play a central role in many of the key aspects of delivering and storing energy in future. 

In a world of intermittent renewable energy generation, accurate forecasting is essential: we have used Gaussian processes to predict tidal energy resource. Analytics is also increasingly important to getting the best use out of electrical batteries. We have used machine learning both to monitor battery state-of-health, and to deliver an integrated management scheme for batteries co-located with renewable energy generation.
