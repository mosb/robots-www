Mike Osborne is a Professor of Machine Learning in the Department of Engineering Science. He has acted as principal or co-investigator for Â£10.6M of research funding. He has expertise in active learning, Gaussian processes, Bayesian optimisation, and Bayesian quadrature, and is a co-founder of the emerging field of probabilistic numerics. His algorithms have been applied in fields as diverse as astrostatistics, ornithology, and sensor networks. Mike is also the co-founder of the Oxford spin-out company Mind Foundry Ltd, which has grown to thirty employees (including eleven PhDs). Finally, Mike's work on the societal impacts of machine learning and robotics has been cited over 5000 times, and resulted in both sustained coverage in almost all major media venues (e.g. his being interviewed on BBC Newsnight, a cover feature in the Economist) and policy impact (including presenting oral evidence to the UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee).
