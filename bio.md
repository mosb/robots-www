Dr. Mike Osborne is a Professor of Machine Learning in the Department of Engineering Science at Oxford University. His work on automation and its impact on the world of work, with Carl Benedikt Frey, has been covered by BBC Newsnight, CNN, The Economist, Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, Foreign Affairs, New York Times, Washington Post, Der Spiegel, Scientific American, TIME Magazine and The Guardian, amongst many other venues.

Mike is the co-founder and Chief Science Officer of [Mind Foundry Ltd,](https://www.mindfoundry.ai) an Oxford spin-out company, which has grown to 70+ employees. This firm brings together the world’s best scientists, engineers, design-thinkers and more to tackle the most challenging problems across numerous industries. They are innovators, changemakers and helpful stewards of AI as it begins to shape our world.

Mike has attracted £18.8M of research funding. He has expertise in Gaussian processes, Bayesian optimisation, and Bayesian quadrature, and is a co-founder of the emerging field of probabilistic numerics. His algorithms have been applied in fields as diverse as battery modelling, ornithology, and quantum devices.

Mike’s work on the societal impacts of machine learning and robotics has been cited over 15,000 times, and has resulted in both sustained coverage in almost all major media venues (e.g. his being interviewed on BBC Newsnight, a cover feature in the Economist) and policy impact (his methodology was employed by Obama's Council of Economic Advisors, Teresa May’s Taylor Report and was built upon by many international institutions, including the OECD, McKinsey, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund).
