<h2>Lecturing</h2>

<h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/aims_cdt" >
    Data, Estimation and Inference
</a></h3>
<p>
    This course will be taught within the <a href="http://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/">AIMS CDT.</a> It will include an introduction to probability theory, including various properties of distributions and their representation as belief networks. It covers maximum likelihood estimation and compares against Bayesian inference, before introducing decision theory and classification. The course continues by covering Gaussian processes.

    <h2>Old Courses</h2>

    <h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/c24" >C24 Advanced Probability Theory</a></h3>
    <p>
        This course is really less esoteric than its name might suggest, providing a grounded review of probabilistic tools relevant for many applications in data science and predictive analytics. In particular, the course will cover model comparison, the value of information, Gaussian processes.

    <h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/b14">B14 Inference</a></h3>
    <p> This course covers maximum likelihood estimation and compares against Bayesian inference. The course concludes by introducing decision theory and classification.

    <h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/c19" >C19 Machine Learning: Inference</a></h3>
    <p>
        Machine learning is a rapidly developing field that lies at the intersection of statistics and computer science. Its growth can be partially attributed to the vast quantities of data (known as "big data") that are now routinely being captured in science and industry. Machine learning aims to find means of taking decisions upon data that are both computationally tractable and statistically principled. This course will briefly introduce core concepts in machine learning: supervised vs unsupervised learning; nearest neighbour methods; the challenge of generalisation; and approximate inference (in the form of Laplace's method and variational methods).

    <h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/b16">
B16 Object Oriented Programming</a></h3>
    <p> This course provides a brief introduction to object-oriented design, along with an introduction to C++. It covers: encapsulation; constructors; implementation and interface; functions and operators, inheritance and composition; polymorphism; and templates.
