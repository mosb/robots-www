	abstract = {We construct and apply a stochastic Gaussian Process (GP) model of flight trajectory generation for pigeons trained to home from specific release sites. The model shows increasing pre- dictive power as the birds become familiar with the sites, mirroring the animal’s learning process. We show how the increasing similarity between successive flight trajectories can be used to infer, with increasing accuracy, an idealised route that captures the repeated spatial aspects of the bird’s flight. We subsequently use techniques associated with reduced-rank GP approximations to objec- tively identify the key waypoints used by each bird to memorise its idiosyncratic habitual route between the release site and the home loft.},

	abstract = {Existing work in multi-agent collision prediction and avoidance typically assumes discrete-time tra jectories with Gaussian uncertainty or that are completely deterministic. We propose an approach that allows detection of collisions even between continuous, stochastic trajectories with the only restriction that means and covariances can be computed. To this end, we employ probabilistic bounds to derive criterion functions whose nega tive sign provably is indicative of probable colli sions. For criterion functions that are Lipschitz, an algorithm is provided to rapidly find negative values or prove their absence. We propose an iterative policy-search approach that avoids prior discretisations and yields collision-free trajectories with adjustably high certainty. We test our method with both fixed-priority and auction based protocols for coordinating the iterative plan ning process. Results are provided in collision avoidance simulations of feedback controlled plants.},

	abstract = {We describe a Bayesian formalism for the intelligent selection of observations from sensor networks that may intermittently undergo faults or changepoints. Such active data selection is performed with the goal of taking as few observations as necessary in order to maintain a reasonable level of uncertainty about the variables of interest. The presence of faults/changepoints is not always obvious and therefore our algorithm must first detect their occurrence. Having done so, our selection of observations must be appropriately altered. Faults corrupt our observations, reducing their impact; changepoints (abrupt changes in the characteristics of data) may require the transition to an entirely different sampling schedule. Our solution is to employ a Gaussian process formalism that allows for sequential time-series prediction about variables of interest along with a decision theoretic approach to the problem of selecting observations.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the question of how much a previously obtained map of a road environment should be trusted for vehicle localisation, during autonomous driving, by assessing the probability that roadworks are being traversed. We compare two formulations of a roadwork prior: one based on Gaussian Process (GP) Classification and the other a more conventional Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in order to model correlations between nearby parts of a vehicle trajectory. Impor- tantly, our formulation allows this prior to be updated efficiently and repeatedly to gain an ever more accurate model of the environment over time. In the absence of, or in addition to, any in-situ observations, information from dedicated web resources can readily be incorporated into the framework. We evaluate our model using real data from an autonomous car and show that although the GP and HMM are roughly commensurate in terms of mapping roadworks, the GP provides a more powerful representation and lower prediction error. Our method allows us to truly map and anticipate roadworks on urban roads.},

The central challenge in probabilistic inference is numerical integration, to average over ensembles of models or unknown (hyper-)parameters (for example to compute the marginal likelihood or a partition function). MCMC has provided approaches to numerical integration that deliver state-of-the-art inference, but can suffer from sample inefficiency and poor convergence diagnostics. Bayesian quadrature techniques offer a model-based solution to such problems, but their uptake has been hindered by prohibitive computation costs. We introduce a warped model for probabilistic integrands (likelihoods) that are known to be non-negative, permitting a cheap active learning scheme to optimally select sample locations. Our algorithm is demonstrated to offer faster convergence (in seconds) relative to simple Monte Carlo and annealed importance sampling on both synthetic and real-world examples.},

If the function has additional inputs, our covariances can be readily extended to incorporate them—allowing us to consider, for example, functions over both sets and time. These functions can then be optimized using Gaussian process global optimization (GPGO). We use the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions made using a set of sensors at a particular time as an example of such a function to be optimized; the optimal point specifies the best choice of sensor locations. We demonstrate the resulting method by dynamically selecting the best subset of a given set of weather sensors for the prediction of the air temperature across the United Kingdom.},

In this paper, we present the first probabilistic integrator that admits such theoretical treatment, called Frank-Wolfe Bayesian Quadrature (FWBQ).

In simulations, FWBQ is competitive with state-of-the-art methods and out-performs alternatives based on Frank-Wolfe optimisation.

The classical methodology of harmonic analysis is widely used in the prediction of tidal currents and computer algorithms based on the method have been used for decades for the purpose. The approach determines parameters by minimizing the difference between the raw data and model output using the least squares optimization approach. However, although the approach is considered to be state-of-the-art, it possesses several drawbacks that can lead to significant prediction errors, especially at locations of fast tidal currents and ’noisy’ tidal signal. In general, careful selection of tidal constituents is required in order to achieve good predictions, and the underlying assumption of stationarity in time can restrict the applicability of the method to particular situations. There is a need for principled approaches which can handle uncertainty and accommodate noise in the data. In this work, we use Gaussian process, a Bayesian non-parametric technique, to predict tidal currents. The overall objective is to take advantage of the recent progress in machine learning to construct a robust yet efficient algorithm. The development can specifically benefit the tidal energy community, aiming to harness energy from location of fast tidal currents.},

	abstract = {The computational and storage complexity of kernel machines presents the primary barrier to their scaling to large, modern, datasets. A common way to tackle the scalability issue is to use the conjugate gradient algorithm, which relieves the constraints on both storage (the kernel matrix need not be stored) and computation (both stochastic gradients and parallelization can be used). Even so, conjugate gradient is not without its own issues: the conditioning of kernel matrices is often such that conjugate gradients will have poor convergence in practice. Preconditioning is a common approach to alleviating this issue. Here we propose preconditioned conjugate gradients for kernel machines, and develop a broad range of preconditioners particularly useful for kernel matrices. We describe a scalable approach to both solving kernel machines and learning their hyperparameters. We show this approach is exact in the limit of iterations and outperforms state-of-the-art approximations for a given computational budget.},

	abstract = {An increasing awareness of energy efficiency has led to the development of several improved converter topologies, semiconductor devices and control schemes for distributed energy resources, and, particularly, for microgrids. Recent advances in energy management systems (EMS) for microgrids have improved upon existing methods in several aspects, including prediction of power generated by photovoltaics (PV), and optimal management of electrical energy storage. However, the actual generated PV power may deviate from predictions for several reasons, such as rapid cloud changes or system faults. This paper contributes to the ongoing research on EMS control schemes by proposing a model predictive control (MPC) scheme that adapts to the difference between the actual and predicted output power of PV. The key benefit of this approach is its ability to rapidly adapt to varying operating conditions of the PV without increasing the computational burden of a typical MPC scheme. The feasibility of the scheme is demonstrated using simulations of 5 kW microgrid system compromising a 5 kW/400 Ah battery, 10 kW PV and 5 kW grid/load connection. The proposed scheme reduces variations in the state of charge (SOC) of a battery. The proposed scheme also reduces the energy taken from grid and this improvement in performance is a function of the difference between the actual and the predicted power.},

Lately, the combination of multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and Gaussian process classification (GPC) has gained interest in the neuroscientific community. Here, we demonstrate how a MVPA-GPC approach can be applied to electrophysiological data. Furthermore, in order to account for the temporal information of ERPs, we develop a novel method that integrates interregional synchrony of ERP time signatures. By using real-life ERP recordings of a prospective AD cohort study (PRODEM), we empirically investigate the usefulness of the proposed framework to build neurophysiological markers for single subject classification tasks. GPC outperforms the probabilistic reference method in both tasks, with the highest AUC overall (0.802) being achieved using the new spatiotemporal method in the prediction of rapid cognitive decline.},

In the spirit of probabilistic numerics, we reinterpret the problem of computing the log-determinant as a Bayesian inference problem. In particular, we combine prior knowledge in the form of bounds from matrix theory and evidence derived from stochastic trace estimation to obtain probabilistic estimates for the log-determinant and its associated uncertainty within a given computational budget. Beyond its novelty and theoretic appeal, the performance of our proposal is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches to approximating the log-determinant, while also quantifying the uncertainty due to budget-constrained evidence.},

Gps are commonly used for tasks such as trajectory modelling, where path length is a crucial quantity of interest. Previously, only paths in one dimension have been considered, with no theoretical consideration of higher dimensional problems. We fill the gap in the existing literature by deriving the moments of the arc length for a stationary gp with multiple output dimensions. A new method is used to derive the mean of a one-dimensional gp over a finite interval, by considering the distribution of the arc length integrand. This technique is used to derive an approximate distribution over the arc length of a vector valued gp in Rn by moment matching the distribution. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical derivations.},

This paper considers the problem of finding a robust policy while taking into account the impact of environment variables. We present Alternating Optimisation and Quadrature (ALOQ), which uses Bayesian optimisation and Bayesian quadrature to address such settings. ALOQ is robust to the presence of significant rare events, which may not be observable under random sampling, but play a substantial role in determining the optimal policy. Experimental results across different domains show that ALOQ can learn more efficiently and robustly than existing methods.},

	abstract = {Accurate on-board capacity estimation is of critical importance in lithium-ion battery applications. Battery charging/discharging often occurs under a constant current load, and hence voltage vs. time measurements under this condition may be accessible in practice. This paper presents a novel diagnostic technique, Gaussian Process regression for In-situ Capacity Estimation (GP-ICE), which is capable of estimating the battery capacity using voltage vs. time measurements over short periods of galvanostatic operation.The approach uses Gaussian process regression to map from voltage values at a selection of uniformly distributed times, to cell capacity. Unlike previous works, GP-ICE does not rely on interpreting the voltage-time data through the lens of Incremental Capacity (IC) or Differential Voltage (DV) analysis. This overcomes both the need to differentiate the voltage-time data (a process which amplifies measurement noise), and the requirement that the range of voltage measurements encompasses the peaks in the IC/DV curves. Rather, GP-ICE gives insight into which portions of the voltage range are most informative about the capacity for a particular cell. We apply GP-ICE to a dataset of 8 cells, which were aged by repeated application of an ARTEMIS urban drive cycle. Within certain voltage ranges, as little as 10 seconds of charge data is sufficient to enable capacity estimates with ∼ 2\% RMSE.},

Other scalable Bayesian deep learning methods, like MC dropout or deep ensembles, have discrete support-they assign zero probability to almost all of the weight-space. Unlike these discrete support methods, Radial BNNs' full support makes them suitable for use as a prior for sequential inference. In addition, they solve the conceptual challenges with the a priori implausibility of weight distributions with discrete support. The Radial BNN is motivated by avoiding a sampling problem in 'mean-field' variational inference (MFVI) caused by the so-called 'soap-bubble' pathology of multivariate Gaussians. We show that, unlike MFVI, Radial BNNs are robust to hyperparameters and can be efficiently applied to a challenging real-world medical application without needing ad-hoc tweaks and intensive tuning. In fact, in this setting Radial BNNs out-perform discrete-support methods like MC dropout. Lastly, by using Radial BNNs as a theoretically principled, robust alternative to MFVI we make significant strides in a Bayesian continual learning evaluation.},

	abstract = {Neural architecture search (NAS) automates the design of deep neural networks. One of the main challenges in searching complex and non-continuous architectures is to compare the similarity of networks that the conventional Euclidean metric may fail to capture. Optimal transport (OT) is resilient to such complex structure by considering the minimal cost for transporting a network into another. However, the OT is generally not negative definite which may limit its ability to build the positive-definite kernels required in many kernel-dependent frameworks. Building upon tree-Wasserstein (TW), which is a negative definite variant of OT, we develop a novel discrepancy for neural architectures, and demonstrate it within a Gaussian process surrogate model for the sequential NAS settings. Furthermore, we derive a novel parallel NAS, using quality k-determinantal point process on the GP posterior, to select diverse and high-performing architectures from a discrete set of candidates. Empirically, we demonstrate that our TW-based approaches outperform other baselines in both sequential and parallel NAS.},

Despite the success of Bayesian optimisation methods on continuous domains, domains that are categorical, or that mix continuous and categorical variables, remain challenging. We propose a novel solution -- we combine local optimisation with a tailored kernel design, effectively handling high-dimensional categorical and mixed search spaces, whilst retaining sample efficiency. We further derive convergence guarantee for the proposed approach. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that our method outperforms the current baselines on a variety of synthetic and real-world tasks in terms of performance, computational costs, or both.},

	abstract = {Efficient optimisation of black-box problems that comprise both continuous and categorical inputs is important, yet poses significant challenges. We propose a new approach, Continuous and Categorical Bayesian Optimisation (CoCaBO), which combines the strengths of multi-armed bandits and Bayesian optimisation to select values for both categorical and continuous inputs. We model this mixed-type space using a Gaussian Process kernel, designed to allow sharing of information across multiple categorical variables, each with multiple possible values; this allows CoCaBO to leverage all available data efficiently. We extend our method to the batch setting and propose an efficient selection procedure that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation whilst encouraging batch diversity. We demonstrate empirically that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world optimisation tasks with continuous and categorical inputs.},

	abstract = {Bayesian optimization has demonstrated impressive success in finding the optimum location x* and value f*=f(x*)=max f(x) of the black-box function f. In some applications, however, the optimum value is known in advance and the goal is to find the corresponding optimum location. Existing work in Bayesian optimization (BO) has not effectively exploited the knowledge of f* for optimization. In this paper, we consider a new setting in BO in which the knowledge of the optimum value is available. Our goal is to exploit the knowledge about f* to search for the location x* efficiently. To achieve this goal, we first transform the Gaussian process surrogate using the information about the optimum value. Then, we propose two acquisition functions, called confidence bound minimization and expected regret minimization, which exploit the knowledge about the optimum value to identify the optimum location efficiently. We show that our approaches work both intuitively and quantitatively achieve better performance against standard BO methods. We demonstrate real applications in tuning a deep reinforcement learning algorithm on the CartPole problem and XGBoost on Skin Segmentation dataset in which the optimum values are publicly available.},

	abstract = {Achieving the full promise of the Thermodynamic Variational Objective (TVO), a recently proposed variational lower bound on the log evidence involving a one-dimensional Riemann integral approximation, requires choosing a "schedule" of sorted discretization points. This paper introduces a bespoke Gaussian process bandit optimization method for automatically choosing these points. Our approach not only automates their one-time selection, but also dynamically adapts their positions over the course of optimization, leading to improved model learning and inference. We provide theoretical guarantees that our bandit optimization converges to the regret-minimizing choice of integration points. Empirical validation of our algorithm is provided in terms of improved learning and inference in Variational Autoencoders and Sigmoid Belief Networks.},

	abstract = {Current neural architecture search (NAS) strategies focus only on finding a single, good, architecture. They offer little insight into why a specific network is performing well, or how we should modify the architecture if we want further improvements. We propose a Bayesian optimisation (BO) approach for NAS that combines the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel with a Gaussian process surrogate. Our method optimises the architecture in a highly data-efficient manner: it is capable of capturing the topological structures of the architectures and is scalable to large graphs, thus making the high-dimensional and graph-like search spaces amenable to BO. More importantly, our method affords interpretability by discovering useful network features and their corresponding impact on the network performance. Indeed, we demonstrate empirically that our surrogate model is capable of identifying useful motifs which can guide the generation of new architectures. We finally show that our method outperforms existing NAS approaches to achieve the state of the art on both closed- and open-domain search spaces.},

	title = {Bayesian {Optimization} for {Iterative} {Learning}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09593},
	abstract = {The performance of deep (reinforcement) learning systems crucially depends on the choice of hyperparameters. Their tuning is notoriously expensive, typically requiring an iterative training process to run for numerous steps to convergence. Traditional tuning algorithms only consider the final performance of hyperparameters acquired after many expensive iterations and ignore intermediate information from earlier training steps. In this paper, we present a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach which exploits the iterative structure of learning algorithms for efficient hyperparameter tuning. We propose to learn an evaluation function compressing learning progress at any stage of the training process into a single numeric score according to both training success and stability. Our BO framework is then balancing the benefit of assessing a hyperparameter setting over additional training steps against their computation cost. We further increase model efficiency by selectively including scores from different training steps for any evaluated hyperparameter set. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm by tuning hyperparameters for the training of deep reinforcement learning agents and convolutional neural networks. Our algorithm outperforms all existing baselines in identifying optimal hyperparameters in minimal time.},
