	title = {Towards auction-based multi-agent collision-avoidance under continuous stochastic dynamics},
	abstract = {We describe an approach to multi-agent planning under continuous stochastic dynamics. The approach yields collision-free state tra jectories with adjustably high certainty, while aiming for low social cost. To this end we describe a collision-detection module based on a distribution-independent probabilistic bound. We employ an optimization-based approach to incrementally alter plans until all collisions are avoided with sufficiently high confidence. We consider the case of feedback controlled agents, and alter plans by introducing new setpoints to the agents’ controllers. In the context of a simple stochastic path planning scenario, we compare two alternative strategies for finding such setpoints.
Due to their practical importance, multi-agent collision avoidance and control have been extensively studied across different communities including AI, robotics and control. However, these works typically assume linear and discrete dynamic models; by contrast, our work intends to overcome these limitations and to present solutions for continuous state space. While our current experiments were conducted with linear stochastic differential equation (SDE) models with state-independent noise (yielding Gaussian processes) our method is also applicable to non-Gaussian cases with state-dependent uncertainties.
To ensure collision avoidance yields low social cost across the entire agent collective, we compare two different coordination mechanisms. Firstly, we consider a simple fixed-priority scheme Erdmann \& Lozano-Perez (1987), and secondly, we modify an auction-based coordination protocol Calliess et al. (2011) to work in our continuous setting. In contrast to pre-existing work in auction-style multi-agent planning (e.g. Tovey et al. (2005); Lagoudakis et al. (2005); Calliess et al. (2011)) and multi-agent collision avoidance (e.g. Kostic et al. (2010); Ayanian \& Kumar (2010)), we avoid a priori discretizations of space and time and present solutions for continuous time and state space.},

	title = {A machine learning approach to pattern detection and prediction for environmental monitoring and water sustainability},
	abstract = {We describe one of the successful products of a research partnership among several academic institutions (CMU, Oxford and UBC) and a water monitoring company (Aquatic Informatics). Water monitoring sensors are very diverse and remotely distributed. They produce vast quantities of data. The data itself is nonlinear and nonstationary. In addition, unanticipated environmental conditions and limitations in the sensing and communications hardware cause the data to be corrupted by previously uncharacterized nonlinearities, missing observations, spikes and multiple discontinuities. To improve the quality of the data and the monitoring process, this paper introduces an approach that uses Gaussian processes and a general “fault bucket” to capture a priori uncharacterized faults, along with an approximate method for marginalizing the potential faultiness of all observations. This gives rise to an efficient, flexible algorithm for the detection and automatic correction of faults. The probabilistic nature of the method is ideal for reporting uncertainty estimates to human operators. The approach can also be applied to detect patterns, other than faults, which are of great environmental significance. We present a fish sustainability example, where specific patterns in water level need to be detected so that fish don’t get trapped and die in shallow pools.},

	volume = {2},
	url = {http://goo.gl/4DmFW4},
	abstract = {The interpretation of HST transmission spectroscopy signals has recently
been the subject of much debate, in particular the NIR NICMOS data of HD
189733. At optical wavelengths, a high-altitude haze has been confirmed
with both STIS and ACS, whereas the presence of molecules has been
claimed with NICMOS. However, this detection of molecules has been
disputed based on the ad hoc model used to remove the systematics, the
choice of which changes the interpretation of the transmission signal.
Here, we introduce a powerful new technique, Gaussian Processes (GPs),
to model the systematics and simultaneously extract the transmission
spectrum, and demonstrate its application to the NICMOS data. GPs are a
Bayesian technique widely used in the machine learning community, which
allow us to define a distribution over functions. Rather than impose a
strict, functional form of systematics correction, we marginalise over
potentially infinite numbers of basis functions, effectively inferring
the form of the systematics correction from the data itself. This
results in a more robust interpretation of the signal. We also present
similar analyses of HST/WFC3 observations of HD 189733, which bridge the
gap between the current optical and NIR spectrum.},

For instance, we may wish to search over neural network architectures with an unknown number of layers. To relate performance data gathered for different architectures, we define a new kernel for conditional parameter spaces that explicitly includes information about which parameters are relevant in a given structure. We show that this kernel improves model quality and Bayesian optimization results over several simpler baseline kernels.},

For the first problem, we developed a low complexity algorithm based on the spatial best linear unbiased estimator (S-BLUE). Next, building on the S-BLUE, we address the second problem, and develop an efficient algorithm for query based sensor set selection with performance guarantee. Our algorithm is based on the Cross Entropy method which solves the combinatorial optimization problem in an efficient manner.},
