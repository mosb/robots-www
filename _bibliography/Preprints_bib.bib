	abstract = {We present Blitzkriging, a new approach to fast inference for Gaussian processes, applicable to regression, optimisation and classification. State-of-the-art (stochastic) inference for Gaussian processes on very large datasets scales cubically in the number of 'inducing inputs', variables introduced to factorise the model. Blitzkriging shares state-of-the-art scaling with data, but reduces the scaling in the number of inducing points to approximately linear. Further, in contrast to other methods, Blitzkriging: does not force the data to conform to any particular structure (including grid-like); reduces reliance on error-prone optimisation of inducing point locations; and is able to learn rich (covariance) structure from the data. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on real data in regression, time-series prediction and signal-interpolation experiments.},

	title = {Anomaly detection and removal using nonstationary {Gaussian} processes},
	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel Gaussian process approach to
fault removal in time-series data. Fault removal does not delete
the faulty signal data but, instead, massages the fault from
the data. We assume that only one fault occurs at any one
time and model the signal by two separate non-parametric
Gaussian process models for both the physical phenomenon
and the fault. In order to facilitate fault removal we introduce
the Markov Region Link kernel for handling non-stationary
Gaussian Processes. This kernel is piece-wise stationary but
guarantees that functions generated by it and their derivatives
(when required) are everywhere continuous. We apply this
kernel to the removal of drift and bias errors in faulty sensor
data and also to the recovery of EOG artifact corrupted EEG
signals.},

	abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) bring together thousands of people from different geographies and demographic backgrounds -- but to date, little is known about how they learn or communicate. We introduce a new content-analysed MOOC dataset and use Bayesian Non-negative Matrix Factorization (BNMF) to extract communities of learners based on the nature of their online forum posts. We see that BNMF yields a superior probabilistic generative model for online discussions when compared to other models, and that the communities it learns are differentiated by their composite students' demographic and course performance indicators. These findings suggest that computationally efficient probabilistic generative modelling of MOOCs can reveal important insights for educational researchers and practitioners and help to develop more intelligent and responsive online learning environments.},

particularly useful for their flexibility, facilitating accurate prediction even in the absence of strong

GPs further allow us to work within a complete Bayesian probabilistic framework. As such, we
show how the hyperparameters of our system can be marginalised by use of Bayesian Monte Carlo, a
principled method of approximate integration. We employ the error bars of our GP’s predictions as
a means to select only the most informative data to store. This allows us to introduce an iterative
formulation of the GP to give a dynamic, on-line algorithm. We also show how our error bars can be
used to perform active data selection, allowing the GP to select where and when it should next take a
measurement.
We demonstrate how our methods can be applied to multi-sensor prediction problems where data
may be missing, delayed and/or correlated. In particular, we present a real network of weather sensors
as a testbed for our algorithm.},

	abstract = {We introduce a means of automating machine learning (ML) for big data tasks, by performing scalable stochastic Bayesian optimisation of ML algorithm parameters and hyper-parameters. More often than not, the critical tuning of ML algorithm parameters has relied on domain expertise from experts, along with laborious hand-tuning, brute search or lengthy sampling runs. Against this background, Bayesian optimisation is finding increasing use in automating parameter tuning, making ML algorithms accessible even to non-experts. However, the state of the art in Bayesian optimisation is incapable of scaling to the large number of evaluations of algorithm performance required to fit realistic models to complex, big data. We here describe a stochastic, sparse, Bayesian optimisation strategy to solve this problem, using many thousands of noisy evaluations of algorithm performance on subsets of data in order to effectively train algorithms for big data. We provide a comprehensive benchmarking of possible sparsification strategies for Bayesian optimisation, concluding that a Nystrom approximation offers the best scaling and performance for real tasks. Our proposed algorithm demonstrates substantial improvement over the state of the art in tuning the parameters of a Gaussian Process time series prediction task on real, big data.},

PA algorithms are formulated in terms of deterministic point-estimation problems governed by a set of user-defined hyperparameters: the approach fails to capture model/prediction uncertainty and makes their performance highly sensitive to hyperparameter configurations. In this paper, we introduce a novel PA learning framework for regression that overcomes the above limitations. We contribute a Bayesian state-space interpretation of PA regression, along with a novel online variational inference scheme, that not only produces probabilistic predictions, but also offers the benefit of automatic hyperparameter tuning. Experiments with various real-world data sets show that our approach performs significantly better than a more standard, linear Gaussian state-space model.},

	abstract = {In this paper we use Gaussian Process (GP) regression to propose a novel approach for predicting volatility of financial returns by forecasting the envelopes of the time series. We provide a direct comparison of their performance to traditional approaches such as GARCH. We compare the forecasting power of three approaches: GP regression on the absolute and squared returns; regression on the envelope of the returns and the absolute returns; and regression on the envelope of the negative and positive returns separately. We use a maximum a posteriori estimate with a Gaussian prior to determine our hyperparameters. We also test the effect of hyperparameter updating at each forecasting step. We use our approaches to forecast out-of-sample volatility of four currency pairs over a 2 year period, at half-hourly intervals. From three kernels, we select the kernel giving the best performance for our data. We use two published accuracy measures and four statistical loss functions to evaluate the forecasting ability of GARCH vs GPs. In mean squared error the GP's perform 20\% better than a random walk model, and 50\% better than GARCH for the same data.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel, theoretically-grounded, acquisition function for batch Bayesian optimization informed by insights from distributionally ambiguous optimization. Our acquisition function is a lower bound on the well-known Expected Improvement function -- which requires a multi-dimensional Gaussian Expectation over a piecewise affine function -- and is computed by evaluating instead the best-case expectation over all probability distributions consistent with the same mean and variance as the original Gaussian distribution. Unlike alternative approaches including Expected Improvement, our proposed acquisition function avoids multi-dimensional integrations entirely, and can be computed exactly as the solution of a convex optimization problem in the form of a tractable semidefinite program (SDP). Moreover, we prove that the solution of this SDP also yields exact numerical derivatives, which enable efficient optimization of the acquisition function. Finally, it efficiently handles marginalized posteriors with respect to the Gaussian Process' hyperparameters. We demonstrate superior performance to heuristic alternatives and approximations of the intractable expected improvement, justifying this performance difference based on simple examples that break the assumptions of state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are important models in supervised machine learning. Training in Gaussian processes refers to selecting the covariance functions and the associated parameters in order to improve the outcome of predictions, the core of which amounts to evaluating the logarithm of the marginal likelihood (LML) of a given model. LML gives a concrete measure of the quality of prediction that a GP model is expected to achieve. The classical computation of LML typically carries a polynomial time overhead with respect to the input size. We propose a quantum algorithm that computes the logarithm of the determinant of a Hermitian matrix, which runs in logarithmic time for sparse matrices. This is applied in conjunction with a variant of the quantum linear system algorithm that allows for logarithmic time computation of the form \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{y\}{\textasciicircum}TA{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}mathbf\{y\}\$, where \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{y\}\$ is a dense vector and \$A\$ is the covariance matrix. We hence show that quantum computing can be used to estimate the LML of a GP with exponentially improved efficiency under certain conditions.},

	abstract = {Accurately predicting the future health of batteries is necessary to ensure reliable operation, minimise maintenance costs, and calculate the value of energy storage investments. The complex nature of degradation renders data-driven approaches a promising alternative to mechanistic modelling. This study predicts the changes in battery capacity over time using a Bayesian non-parametric approach based on Gaussian process regression. These changes can be integrated against an arbitrary input sequence to predict capacity fade in a variety of usage scenarios, forming a generalised health model. The approach naturally incorporates varying current, voltage and temperature inputs, crucial for enabling real world application. A key innovation is the feature selection step, where arbitrary length current, voltage and temperature measurement vectors are mapped to fixed size feature vectors, enabling them to be efficiently used as exogenous variables. The approach is demonstrated on the open-source NASA Randomised Battery Usage Dataset, with data of 26 cells aged under randomized operational conditions. Using half of the cells for training, and half for validation, the method is shown to accurately predict non-linear capacity fade, with a best case normalised root mean square error of 4.3\%, including accurate estimation of prediction uncertainty.},
